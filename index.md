## Research

`Summer 2021`
__Georgia Institute of Technology__

Worked as an affiliate to the CRNCH lab where I helped implement the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) as a decoder to a spiking neural network onto various digital and mixed signal architectures. Attended the Telluride Neuromorphic Cognition Engineering Workshop virtually. Mostly, we investigated the FPAA and Braindrop architectures, using the RASP toolchain for the former (albeit we ran into issues with RASP) and Nengo for the latter. 

### Research Advisor
